# Build Playbook

Use this for compilation or dependency failures.

- Capture the build command and build tool version.
- Capture the exact error message and a short log excerpt.
- Ask if the user can reproduce after a clean restore (clear cache, reinstall deps).
- If the repo defines a supported toolchain version, ask to confirm it.
- Suggest enabling verbose build output when possible.
